Ensure the edges of the plunger tube are free of any burrs from cutting and file any burrs away is needed.\
Very Important. Carefully clean the inside of the plunger tube, make sure it is entirely free of any aluminium shavings or particles from cutting/filing.\
Put three or four small drops of 1000ct Silicone Oil into the inside of the plunger tube, and wipe it through to ensure that all of the interior surface of the plunger tube is thinly coated.
